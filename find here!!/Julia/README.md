## 🧠 Fun Fact

Julia was designed for high-performance numerical and scientific computing while being easy to write like Python.
Its name comes from a common human name — simple, memorable, and approachable.
Julia’s just-in-time (JIT) compilation via LLVM makes it fast enough to rival C in many benchmarks, making it a favorite for data scientists and researchers.
