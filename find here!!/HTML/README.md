# 🧠 Fun Fact

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages.  
It structures content on the web using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.  
Although HTML defines the structure of a webpage, it does **not** handle styling or behavior — that’s what CSS and JavaScript are for.  
HTML is constantly evolving, and the latest standard, HTML5, introduced features like video, audio, and semantic elements for modern web development.


# Css 
It is used to enhance the beauty of the elements created by HTML. Adds beauty to the webpage.
