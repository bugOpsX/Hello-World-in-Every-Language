# Hello World in C--

## Description
This program prints "Hello, World!" in C--, a portable assembly language designed for compiler backends.

## How to Run
1. Install the C-- compiler from the Quick C-- project
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   qc-- hello_world.cmm
   ```
3. Run the generated executable

## Fun Fact
C-- (pronounced "C minus minus") was designed by Simon Peyton Jones and Norman Ramsey as a high-level assembly language for compiler writers. Despite its name suggesting it's "less than C", C-- is actually a powerful intermediate language used by the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) to generate portable, efficient code!
